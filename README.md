Sloppa Checklist:

Is the food thick, stew-like, or sauce-heavy?
Is the food presented in a bowl, dish, or on a borderline plate with a risk of spills?
Are the main components meat, noodles, eggs, cooked beans, cooked grains, well-cooked potatoes, or cream/syrup-based desserts?
Does the dish have a significant amount of melted, gooey, or abundant cheese (not required, but can push a dish into sloppa territory)?
Is there a high level of moisture, with visible liquid or sauce?
If the dish is a salad, does it have a high dressing-to-contents ratio or appropriate sloppa-like contents?

If a food picture meets at least 4 out of the 6 criteria in the checklist, it can be considered a "sloppa" and is appropriate for the groupchat. 
Foods that meet 2-3 criteria may be considered borderline sloppa, and the groupchat members can discuss whether they fit the sloppa category. 
Foods that meet fewer than 2 criteria are likely not sloppa and may not fit the expectations of the groupchat.
